# Top Machine learning papers

Currently, there are a large number of topics available Machine learning research which can be implemented real applications. This is field is spreading with a great speed. Among many topics there are some specific topics which are drawing more attention than others.

* Deep learning
* Bayesian statistics
* Natural Language processing
* Support Vector Machines

these are some of the buzz words in the market now.


### Deep learning
Deep Learning is a new area of Machine Learning research. Deep learning algorithms transform their respective inputs through more layers than other learning algorithms.
