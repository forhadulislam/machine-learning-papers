# Top Machine learning papers

Currently, there are a large number of topics available Machine learning research which can be implemented real applications. This is field is spreading with a great speed. Among many topics there are some specific topics which are drawing more attention than others.

* Deep learning
* Bayesian statistics
* Natural Language processing
* Support Vector Machines

these are some of the buzz words in the market now.


### Deep learning
Deep Learning is a new area of Machine Learning research. Deep learning algorithms transform their respective inputs through more layers than other learning algorithms.

Expert Systems with Applications 69 (2017): 29-39. <a href="https://research.aston.ac.uk/portal/files/21468560/Recommendation_system_for_cold_start_items.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>.



### Bayesian statistics
Bayesian means probabilistic.

### Natural Language processing
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, and, in particular, concerned with programming computers to fruitfully process large natural language corpora.

### Support Vector Machines
Support vector machines (SVM) is a statistical learning / machine learning technique with the primary goal of prediction. And it can be applied to binary, continuous, and categorical outcomes analogous to Gaussian, logistic and multinomial regression.
